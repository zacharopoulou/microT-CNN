# microT-CNN
microT-CNN is the latest version of the DIANA-microT-CDS model. Is a deep convolutional neural network approach that characterizes previously neglected functional (non-)canonical binding sites. It achieved greater sensitivity, detecting 1.5-fold more validated genuine miRNA-targets, marking a significant breakthrough in miRNA-target annotation.
