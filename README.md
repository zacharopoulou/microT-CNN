# microT-CNN
microT-CNN is the latest version of the DIANA-microT-CDS model. Is a deep convolutional neural network approach that characterizes previously neglected functional (non-)canonical binding sites. It achieved greater sensitivity, detecting 1.5-fold more validated genuine miRNA-targets, marking a significant breakthrough in miRNA-target annotation.

The tool is free to use under MIT licence, please cite:

# Installation

## Docker

microT-CNN is available as a Docker image in the public repository of Docker Hub under the name of penny0lane/microt_cnn. Inside the image all the scripts are available under the /R/ directory. /Inputs/ directory contains phastcons .Finally, under /microt_temp there are 4 test sample sets allowing for a test run upon loading the image on a container. This is the recommended way of running this tool, as there is no need for any complex dependency installations.
